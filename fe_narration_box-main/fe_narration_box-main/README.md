# DueIt
We don't do hard deadlines here, let's cut down on anxiety and work for a healthier mind too. For this reason, we don't believe in edits, don't edit you task, do it! or delete it and start afresh. Redoing and changing, giving yourself more and more time are old habits, welcome to DueIt! Change begins with you.

## Tech Stack Used
NextJS (Typescript), Tailwind CSS, ShadCn UI, PWA Design philosophy. I have tried to maintain modularity and code quality to the best of my abilities. Deployed on my personal E2 instance running on Google Cloud. Deployed using strategies like reverse proxying using nginx (not a fan of apache personally), creating system service file for maintenace and configuring dns.

## Planning
Right off the bat, I wanted to create a mobile-first design rather than your conventional, traditional dashboard. The design philosophy is for PWA (Progressive Web App). With just a few tweaks here and there, and a nice tiny little manifest.json we can have ourselves a downloadable version of the app, which runs in its own browser instance, providing the modularity of traditional mobile apps while enabling web technologies to be easily scaled up to billions of mobile users. 

## Wireframing
As a first step , I sat down to roughly sketch an idea of how I wanted the app to look. Excalidraw is my fav buddy here. I quickly drew up a wireframe for the app and started working on it. 
Coding is much much easier when you've figured out exactly what you want to do and how you want to do it. Obviously, modifications come but it helps to map it out in one's brain, be it even a simple task manager. A product is a product, and with enough cool features, user loved features, we may have ourselves the next big thing!

## The DueIt Factor
As I was drawing the wireframe I realised how tedious it is going to be if I wanted to write todos for my work. Small tasks go well, but what if I wanna do something, but don't know exactly what to do? Well that's solved. Add your desired goal in DueIt and select one from either alpha, beta or sigma level. These levels represent diff amounts of breakdown of the task. Sigma is maximum, reaching upto 10 subtasks, while alpha will range around 2-3 subtasks.

## How to run
clone the repo, npm i, npm run dev, nothing too fancy.

## Known pitfalls
Due to conflicting react versions in my local system, I had to use the --legacy-peer-deps flag for installing some packages. I have not run the code on another machine, therefore I can only hope it works. If conflict arises, please use the --legacy-peer-deps flag.
